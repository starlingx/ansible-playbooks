# ROLE DESCRIPTION:
#
#   This role synchronizes the system controller /opt/software/metadata
#   directory and ostree repository to the subcloud.
#
#   We can divide this playbook into three files and few common tasks
#   that are necessary.
#   The description of each file is detailed in each of them.
#
#      Force ostree dir sync:
#         Includes the file perform_full_ostree_dir_sync.yml that is executed when
#         the flag force_ostree_dir_sync is set.
#         This is to ensure the existence of the release N ostree directory in an
#         N-1 subcloud.
#
#      Sync patches to USM enabled subcloud:
#         Includes the file sync_patches_to_usm_subcloud.yml that is executed when
#         the flag usm_enabled_on_subcloud is set.
#         This is to synchronize patch metadata and commits for an N or N-1 release.
#
#      Sync patches to non USM enabled subcloud
#         Includes the file sync_patches_to_non_usm_subcloud.yml that is executed when
#         the flag usm_enabled_on_subcloud is not set.
#         Having the ostree repository synchronized by role #1, now we need to transfer
#         the patch metadata files and scripts directories only if host is a non-USM
#         N-1 subcloud.
