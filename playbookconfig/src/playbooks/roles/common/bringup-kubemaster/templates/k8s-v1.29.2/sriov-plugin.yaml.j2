# SRIOV device CNI plugin version 3.6.2
# Based on:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-device-plugin/v3.6.2/
#                deployments/sriovdp-daemonset.yaml

#
# The following modifications have been made:
#
# - A nodeSelector of 'sriovdp' has been added to ensure the sriov device plugin
#   pods only run on appropriately labelled nodes.
# - The config hostPath is explicitly set to 'File'
# - The daemonset is modified to tolerate all NoSchedule taints
# - An updateStrategy was added to the DaemonSet spec to allow controlled template
#   updates of pods with "kubectl apply".
# - The image is set to a stable starlingX version
# - The default configMap is not used.  Rather, a hostPath to the config.json file
#   is used, as resources are populated and based on datanetwork names.
# - For k8s 1.19, the matchLabels are the same as the k8s 1.18 labels to
#   allow a rolling update to succeed.
# - Set CPU requests to 0
# - Set memory request to zero, otherwise it interferes with the ability of application pods
#   to reserve the full amount of memory that K8s says is available.
