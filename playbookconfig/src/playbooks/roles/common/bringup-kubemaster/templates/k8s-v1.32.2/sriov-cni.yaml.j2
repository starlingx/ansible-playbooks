# SRIOV-CNI Version v2.9.0
# Based on:

#
# The following modifications have been made:
#
# - The daemonset is modified to tolerate all NoSchedule taints
# - The cnibin volume hostPath is made variable
# - An updateStrategy was added to the DaemonSet spec to allow controlled template
#   updates of pods with "kubectl apply".
# - The image is set to a stable starlingX version
# - The 'imagePullPolicy: Never' is omitted
# - For k8s 1.19, the matchLabels are the same as the k8s 1.18 labels to
#   allow a rolling update to succeed.
# - Set memory request to zero, otherwise it interferes with the ability of application pods
#   to reserve the full amount of memory that K8s says is available.
