# ROLE DESCRIPTION:
#   This role is to bring up system applications
#

# we need to restart sysinv conductor here because it seem to be caching old data
# this prevents it from interacting with a fresh kubernetes cluster. For example,
# if the user changes OAM network and forces the kubernetes cluster to be torn down
# and brought up again.
