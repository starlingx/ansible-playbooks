# SYSTEM PROPERTIES
# =================
system_mode: simplex
# configure distributed cloud role, valid values are 'none', 'systemcontroller',
# and 'subcloud'.  However subclouds are automatically provisioned during their
# creation in dcmanager and are not meant to be configured manually by the user.

# The parameter virtual_system provides the ability to configure system running
# in an OpenStack Nova VM(QEMU/KVM environment) with a limited system resources
# (ie.disk,cpu ...) and it's only intended for testing in lab environments.
# Note: Only All-in-one type of system that is not a system controller
#       (i.e. distributed_cloud_role is either 'none' or 'subcloud') can be
#       configured as virtual system.
#
# virtual_system: true

# NETWORK PROPERTIES
# ==================
#
# Unless specified in the host override file, the start and end addresses of
# each subnet are derived from the provided CIDR as follows:
#   For pxebook, management, oam, multicast, and cluster host/pod/service subnets:
#     - start address: index 1 of CIDR
#     - end address: index -2 of CIDR
#     e.g. management_subnet (provided/default): 192.168.204.0/28
#          management_start_address (derived): 192.168.204.1
#          management_end_address (derived): 192.168.204.14
#
# Unless specified, the external_oam_node_0_address and external_oam_node_1_address
# are derived from the external_oam_floating address as follows:
#   external_oam_node_0_address: next address after external_oam_floating_address
#   external_oam_node_1_address: next address after external_oam_node_0_address
#   e.g. external_oam_floating_address (provided/default): 10.10.10.2
#        external_oam_node_0_address (derived): 10.10.10.3
#        external_oam_node_1_address (derived): 10.10.10.4

# CUSTOMIZED BANNERS
# ==================
#
# It is possible to customize the pre-login message (issue) and post-login
# Message of the Day (MOTD) across the entire Cloud Platform cluster during
# system bootstrap by configuring the "banner" variable.
#
# The issue message can be configured for both SSH and console
# welcome screens, while the MOTD can have customized header and/or footer
# messages. All of these messages should be formatted as a multiline string
# entry. For each category, it is possible to define either one or both
# parameters, or leave them undefined. If parameters are left undefined,
# default values will be applied for each message.
#
# MOTD complete message is generated from the following sources in the order
# presented:
# * /etc/motd.head (it is created from defined MOTD head message)
# * /etc/sysinv/motd.system
# * /etc/platform/motd.license
# * /etc/motd.tail (it is created from defined MOTD tail message)

# DOCKER PROXIES
# ==============
#
# If the host OAM network is behind a proxy, Docker must be configured with
# the same proxy. When an http and/or https proxy is provided, a no-proxy
# address list can optionally be provided. This list will be added to the
# default no-proxy list derived from localhost, loopback, management and oam
# floating addresses at run time. Each address in the list must neither
# contain a wildcard nor have subnet format.

# docker_http_proxy: http://proxy.com:1234
# docker_https_proxy: https://proxy.com:1234
# docker_no_proxy:
#   - 1.2.3.4
#   - 5.6.7.8

# DOCKER REGISTRIES
# =================
#
# The docker_registries is a map of known registry keys and their
# source attributes. Each key is a fully scoped registry name and the
# same name is used as the default url attribute. Other attributes include
# username and password for authenticated registries. For instance,
# k8s.gcr.io registry which hosts Kubernetes related images, has
# the default registry url value of k8s.gcr.io
#
# To overwrite a particular registry url, use the url of the original
# registry value as the key followed by a custom IP address or domain
# for the value.
# If the registry is authenticated, specify username and password. The
# optional key "type" is only relevant to authenticated registry, it
# indicates the type of authenticated registry, supported values are
# "docker" and "aws-ecr". If no type specified, the default type "docker"
# will be used.
# The optional key "secure" provides the ability to configure an insecure
# registry, the default value is "True".
#
# e.g.
#   docker_registries:
#     k8s.gcr.io:
#       url: my.k8sregistry.io
#       type: docker
#       username: k8sreguser
#       password: K8sregPass*
#       secure: True
#
# The "defaults" is registry key defines common values that to be applied
# to all override-able public registries. The following example will apply
# "url", "type", "username" and "password" to docker.io, gcr.io, k8s.gcr.io,
# quay.io, ghcr.io, registryk8s, icr.io and docker.elastic.co registries.
# e.g.
#   docker_registries:
#     defaults:
#       url: unified.io
#       type: docker
#       username: adminUser
#       password: adminPass
#
# The values under the specific registries, if specified, will take precedence
# over the values under defaults registry. The following example will apply
# "type", "username" and "password" from the defaults entry to other public
# registries while the "url" is different for each public registry.
# e.g.
#   docker_registries:
#     docker.io:
#        url: my.dockerregistry.io
#     gcr.io:
#        url: my.gcrregistry.io
#     quay.io:
#       url: my.quayregistry.io
#     k8s.gcr.io:
#       url: my.k8sregistry.io
#     docker.elastic.co:
#       url: my.elasticregistry.io
#     ghcr.io:
#       url: my.ghcr.io
#     registry.k8s.io:
#       url: my.registryk8s.io
#     icr.io:
#       url: my.icrregistry.io
#     defaults:
#       type: docker
#       username: adminUser
#       password: adminPass
#
# The docker registries map can be extended with new custom keys in
# the near future.
#
# The valid formats for a registry url value are:
#   - domain (e.g. example.domain)
#   - domain with port (e.g. example.domain:5000)
#   - IPv4 address (e.g. 1.2.3.4)
#   - IPv4 address with port (e.g. 1.2.3.4:5000)
#   - IPv6 address (e.g. FD01::0100)
#   - IPv6 address with port (e.g. [FD01::0100]:5000
#

# ADDITIONAL IMAGES
# =================
#
# This parameter provides a means to pre-pull additional images to local
# docker registry.
#
# The additional_local_registry_images is a list of image references that
# will be downloaded from public/private registry and pushed to local registry.
# This value must be a list and each image reference in the list must be
# fully specified.
#
# additional_local_registry_images:
#   - <registry-url>/image1:v1.0
#   - <registry-url>/image2:v2.0
#   ...

# CERTIFICATES
# ============
#
# These values provide a means to install certificates onto the system.
# For example the ssl_ca_cert parameter may be used to install a trusted CA to
# the system. A trusted CA certificate will be required if the end user
# configures a private docker registry that is signed by an unknown Certificate
# Authority.
#
# The certificate value is the absolute path of the certificate file.
# The certificate must be in PEM format.
# The supported certificates are:
#   - ssl_ca_cert
#   - k8s_root_ca_cert
#   - k8s_root_ca_key
#   - etcd_root_ca_cert
#   - etcd_root_ca_key
#
# ssl_ca_cert: /path/to/ssl_ca_cert_file


# KUBERNETES PARAMETERS
# =====================
#
# These values provide a means to specify different configuration parameters
# for kubernetes
#
# The apiserver_cert_sans is a list of Subject Alternative Names that will be
# applied to apiserver certificate. This value must be a list and each entry
# in the list must be a domain name or IP address.

# apiserver_cert_sans:
#   - hostname.domain
#   - 198.51.100.75

# These values are used to configure the Kubernetes cluster for authentication
# with OpenID Connect. By default, apiserver_oidc is disabled. When the
# required three fields of the apiserver_oidc parameter are defined, the
# feature is considered active. Their values will be used to configure the
# Kubernetes cluster for authentication with OpenID Connect.
# apiserver_oidc parameters will override oidc-client-id, oidc-issuer-url, oidc-username-claim
# if they are defined in apiserver_extra_args
#
# apiserver_oidc:
#   client_id:
#   issuer_url:
#   username_claim:

# The following parameters (in dictionary format) are used to configure
# Kubernetes control plane components, the kubelet as well as networking respsectively:
#
# apiserver_extra_args: {}
# controllermanager_extra_args: {}
# scheduler_extra_args: {}
#
# kubelet_extra_args: {}
# kubelet_configurations: {}
#
# apiserver_extra_volumes: []
# controllermanager_extra_volumes: []
# scheduler_extra_volumes: []
#
# networking_configurations: {}
#
# By default the system is bootstrapped with a set of default values e.g.
#
# apiserver_extra_args:
#   default-not-ready-toleration-seconds: "30"
#   default-unreachable-toleration-seconds: "30"
#   feature-gates: "TTLAfterFinished=true,RemoveSelfLink=false"
#   event-ttl: "24h"
#
# controllermanager_extra_args:
#   node-monitor-period: "2s"
#   node-monitor-grace-period: "20s"
#   pod-eviction-timeout: '30s'

#
# networking_configurations:
#   dnsDomain: 'cluster.local'
#
# Please refer to the official documentation for more details on these overwritable parameters.
#
# Some extraArgs parameters point out to configuration file, which need to be added in extraVolumes
# section. In order to do that, apiserver_extra_volumes, controllermanager_extra_volumes and
# scheduler_extra_volumes have been added, and must be overrided by the end-user.
# For instance, if admission plugins are configured and they need extra
#     configuration, that configuration should be set in a specific file
#     referenced by admission-control-config-file parameter.
#     Some admission-plugins that need extra configuration are:
#      - PodSecurity
#      - PodNodeSelector
#      - EventRateLimit
#
# Configuration example
