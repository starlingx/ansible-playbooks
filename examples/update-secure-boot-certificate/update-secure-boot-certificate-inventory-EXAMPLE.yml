# This is an example inventory file for use with the
# usr/share/ansible/stx-ansible/playbooks/update_secure_boot_certificate.yml
# playbook.
#
# To run the playbook, define an overrides file (as shown here)
# with the required variable settings and pass it as a parameter
# on the ansible command-line.
#
# Example ansible command:
# ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/stx-ansible/playbooks/update_secure_boot_certificate.yml \
#     -i @my-inventory-file.yml \
#     --extra-vars "target_list=localhost,subcloud1"

# Use target_list to specify individual subclouds, or a comma-separated
# list of subclouds such as 'subcloud1,subcloud2'. To target all online
# subclouds at once, use 'target_list=all_online_subclouds'.
#
# To target the system controller or standalone systems, use 'target_list=localhost'.
#
all:
  vars:
    # The contents to the secure boot certificate to be installed and the KEK
    # to allow writing in UEFI db.
    secure_boot_cert: <base64_cert>
    key_exchange_key: <base64_key>

  children:
    # This will be applied to all online subclouds.
    # Use the example below in hosts to override specific settings for a subcloud, such as passwords.
    target_group:
      vars:
        # SSH password to connect to all subclouds
        ansible_ssh_user: sysadmin
        ansible_ssh_pass: <sysadmin-pwd>
        # Sudo password
        ansible_become_pass: <sysadmin-pwd>
#      Add a child group, as shown below, if you need individual
#      overrides for specific subcloud hosts.
#      Use the hosts section to add the list of hosts.
#      Use the vars section to override target_group variables,
#      such as the ssh password.
#      Note that you can also override multiple hosts at once or
#      have multiple child groups if necessary.
#      Example:
#      children:
#        different_password_group:
#          vars:
#            ansible_ssh_user: sysadmin
#            ansible_ssh_pass: <sysadmin-pwd>
#            ansible_become_pass: <sysadmin-pwd>
#          hosts:
#            subcloud1:
#            subcloud2:
